CRC Algorithms Parallel Computing Library Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q: What is CRC? A: CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is an error detection technique commonly used in digital communication systems to detect transmission errors.

Q: How does parallel CRC calculation work? A: Parallel CRC calculation involves dividing the polynomial and input data into blocks and computing CRC values in parallel for each block. The results are then combined to obtain the final CRC value.

Q: What are the advantages of parallel CRC calculation? A: Parallel CRC calculation enhances efficiency and speed by leveraging the power of multiple processing units or threads. It is particularly useful for processing large datasets.
